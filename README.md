This project was developed for my spreadsheet learning course in college and was intended to demonstrate the skills I acquired during the term. 
It showcases various Excel functions and features, including VLOOKUP, MATCH, INDEX, VBA, data validation, conditional formatting and others. 
The goal of the project was to create a practical tool for the faculty of a school.
