This project was developed for my spreadsheet learning course in college and was intended to demonstrate the skills I acquired during the term. 
It showcases various Excel functions and features, including piviot tables, VLOOKUP, MATCH, INDEX, VBA, data validation, conditional formatting, nested if functions and more. 
The goal of the project was to create a practical tool for the faculty of a school.
